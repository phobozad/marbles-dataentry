# marbles-dataentry
This repository contains data entry tools for LFG Marbles (http://marbles.win)

## MarblersCopier
When run, MarblesCopier will:
 1. Find an open Marbles On Stream window
 2. Click the button to copy results
 3. Immediately click the close button on the annoying popup
 4. Paste the results into an already-open notepad window

To use, run the pre-compiled *.exe under releases (compiled with Aut2Exe)

Or download AutoIT (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/)
and either run the script directly from the *.au3 file or use Aut2Exe to compile the *.au3 (or a modifed version of it) into a self-contained *.exe file.

**Note: Windows defender seems to incorrectly trigger on the .exe file if you compile it, so you may need to tell it to ignore/not quarrantine the file when you build it.**
